2: refers to the second file descriptor of the process, i.e. stderr.

>: means redirection.

&1: means the target of the redirection should be the same location as the first file descriptor, i.e. stdout.




./a.out > outfile 2>&1
- The standard output and error of a.out will redirect to the file called outfile.
- Then redirect the second file descriptor (outfile) to the location of the first file descriptor.
- This will mean that the entire standard output and error of the program a.out will be pointing to the same file descriptor.

./a.out 2>&1 > outfile
- The standard output of a.out will take the second file descriptor (stderr) and the first file descriptor (standard out) and redirect to the first file descritpor.
- This means that both file descriptors are both pointing to the same file table entry.
