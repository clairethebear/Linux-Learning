Q: In Section 7.7, the two file sizes (475570 and 11410) donâ€™t equal the sums of their respective text and data sizes. Why?

A: this is because in one instance we have forced the program to import all of the dependancies for it to run. While in the 
other program, we are querying the shared libraries.
