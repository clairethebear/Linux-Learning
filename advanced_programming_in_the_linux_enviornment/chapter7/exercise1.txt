Q: On an Intel x86 system under both FreeBSD and Linux, if we execute the program that prints “hello, world” and 
do not call exit or return, the termination status of the program, which we can examine with the shell, is 13. Why?

A: If a return number is not specified when exiting a program, it will try and find anything thats stored in memory and 
return this.
