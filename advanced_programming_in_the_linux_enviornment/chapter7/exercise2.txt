Q: When is the output from the printfs in Figure 7.3 actually output?

A: In order this is what will happen once the program is executed:
"main is done"
"first exit handler"
"first exit handler"
"second exit handler"

The reason it happens in that order is that, the print inside main will execute.
Then when exit is called the print at the top of the stack (declared first) will be printed. The rest will follow
in order.
