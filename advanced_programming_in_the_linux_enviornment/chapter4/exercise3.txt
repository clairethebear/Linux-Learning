Q: Verify that turning off user-read permission for a file that you own denies your access to the file.

A: After performaing the following commands:
umask 0444 - this will allow write and execute only when creating any files
touch test_umask - this presented --w--w--w when creating a new file

Result: I was not able to read the file. I was not even able to tab complete on the file.
