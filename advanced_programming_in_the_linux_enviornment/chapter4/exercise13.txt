Q: How can you set only one of the two time values with the utime function?

A: To set the time in utime you need to do the following

struct utimebuf {
	time_t actime; //access time
	time_t modtime; //modificatin time
} 

If one is not declared, the default value will be set to the current time. So the answer to this question would be:

struct utimebuf {
        time_t actime; //access time
}

To whcih modification time will be set to the current time.
