Q: In Figure 4.20, we show the unlink function as modifying the changed-status time of the file itself. How can this happen?


A: The changed-status time of a file is modified when the i-node of the file has been changed. Unlink changes the changed-status
of a file because we decrement the amount of links that are associated with the file. And this changes the i-node.
