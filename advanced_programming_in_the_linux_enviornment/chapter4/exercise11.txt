Q: In Section 4.21, our version of ftw never changes its directory. 

Modify this routine so that each time it encounters a directory, it does a chdir to that directory, 
allowing it to use the filename and not the pathname for each call to lstat. 

When all the entries in a directory have been processed, execute chdir(".."). Compare the time used by this version and the version in the text.
