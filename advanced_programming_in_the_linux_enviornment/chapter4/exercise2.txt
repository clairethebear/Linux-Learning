QUESTION: What happens if the file mode creation mask is set to 777 (octal)? Verify the results using your shellâ€™s umask command.


ANSWER:
If you set this to 777 this means that when creating a file you are effectively not giving you (the owner), groups or other permissions.

You will be able to view the file from the directory, but you will be unable to delete, modify or read the file.

You will however be able to remove the file.
