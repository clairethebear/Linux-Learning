QUESTION: In Section 4.12, we said that a file size of 0 is valid for a regular file. 

We also said that the st_size field is defined for directories and symbolic links. Should we ever see a file size of 0 for a directory or a symbolic link?

ANSWER:
We should never see a file size of 0. 
This is because every time a directory is created, it contains a 'hidden' file called the dotted file. 

This is linked to the directory via a symbolic link, where memory is required to reference i-node to the directory name.
