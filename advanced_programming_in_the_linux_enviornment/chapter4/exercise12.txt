Q: Each process also has a root directory that is used for resolution of absolute pathnames. 

This root directory can be changed with the chroot function. 

Look up the description for this function in your manuals. When might this function be useful?

A: Chroot allows you to run an program and specify the root directory. For example, chroot . bash - this will
run bash inside the folder that you are currently located in. The result of this is that bash see's the directory
as the root directory. 

This might be useful if you want to make a virtual enviornment when developing on a certain directory.

It will only look at that directory as root and not see any other dependancies to do with your real filesystem.

I can see it as keeping a directory and all of its dependancies self contained.
