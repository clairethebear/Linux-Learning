Q: When running the program in Figure 4.16, we check the available disk space with the df(1) command. Why didnâ€™t we use the du(1) command?


A: 
du: Disk Usage, walks through the directory tree and counts the size of each file. It may not be able to display files that are
hard or symbolic links.

df: Desk free. Looks at directly in the filesystem metadata. It will show the results of the entire directory instead of a per file
basis like du. It is also much faster than du and used more often to pin point where the most disk is being used by a file.

We used this for the example because we wanted to see how unlink worked on a directory. With this command we are able to see the amount
of space the directory is taking up on the disk as well as the amount of free space available per block.

Visually, this is easier to understand and track than du
