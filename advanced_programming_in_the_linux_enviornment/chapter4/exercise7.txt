Q: Note in output from the ls command in Section 4.12 that the files core and core.copy have different access permissions. 

If the umask value didnâ€™t change between the creation of the two files, explain how the difference could have occurred.

A: If the umask wasnt set in the program, it would default to the umask that is set for the process that is running the program.

If the effective user ID was the of the owner of the program, then it would be set to their default umask.
