In the output from the program in Figure 1.6, what happened to the processes with the process Ids 852 and 853?

Answer:
The program calls execve followed by exit(0).
According the manual page for exit(3) - exit causes notmal process termination.
In the case of this program, causing execve removes registrations created using atexit(3) and on_exit(3).

In short once the process has completed - it returns to the parent proces and exit(0) is exectured which terminates the current running process.
