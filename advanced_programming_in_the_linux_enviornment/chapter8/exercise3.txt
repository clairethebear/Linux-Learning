The reason this is happening is that when the program is run, once the parent has finished it will start the pgogram again. 
The child might not necessarily be finished yet, so they are both writing to stdout at the same time.

We can correct this by waiting for the child to finish before exiting the parent.

This can be prevented by letting the child write its output first.
